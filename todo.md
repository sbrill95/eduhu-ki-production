# eduhu.ki Development Tasks - PHASE 2 DATABASE PERSISTENCE

## Current Status: PHASE 2A COMPLETED - EXECUTING PHASE 2B
**FOCUS**: Replace ChatContainer React state with InstantDB operations (75 minutes)

### Completed Phases:
- ‚úÖ **PHASE 1 SECURITY**: API key secured, .gitignore implemented, .env.example created
- ‚úÖ **PHASE 2A SETUP**: Real InstantDB app configured (39f14e13-9afb-4222-be45-3d2c231be3a1)
- ‚úÖ **PHASE 3 PWA**: Icons generated, installation process working

### Phase 2B Critical Focus (DEPLOYMENT BLOCKER):
- üéØ **ROOT CAUSE**: ChatContainer uses React state only - no database integration
- üéØ **SOLUTION**: Replace React state with db.transact() and useQuery() operations
- üö® **CRITICAL**: This phase resolves the final deployment blocker

**Deployment Blocked Until**: Phase 2B database integration completed (75 minutes remaining)
