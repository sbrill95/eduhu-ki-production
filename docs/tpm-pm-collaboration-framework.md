## Collaborative Decision-Making Protocol

### Joint Authority Decisions (TPM + PM Required)
1. **Feature Implementation Trade-offs**: When technical complexity impacts delivery timeline
2. **Technical Debt vs. Feature Balance**: Prioritizing technical debt against new features
3. **Performance vs. Feature Trade-offs**: When optimization efforts compete with feature development
4. **Third-party Integration Decisions**: When new integrations affect both technical architecture and project scope
5. **Team Structure Changes**: When technical needs conflict with project resource allocation

### Decision-Making Process
```yaml
Collaborative Decision Framework:
  1. Issue Identification: Either TPM or PM identifies decision requirement
  2. Impact Assessment:
     - TPM: Technical impact, scalability, maintainability
     - PM: Timeline impact, resource requirements, stakeholder impact
  3. Option Analysis: Joint evaluation of alternatives with trade-offs
  4. Stakeholder Input: Gather relevant team and business stakeholder feedback
  5. Joint Decision: Documented decision with clear rationale
  6. Communication: Both TPM and PM communicate decision to respective domains
```

### Escalation Protocols
```yaml
Technical Escalation Path:
  Developer Issue → Senior Backend Architect → TPM → Joint TPM-PM Decision

Project Escalation Path:
  Task Blocker → Backend/Frontend Task Manager → PM → Joint TPM-PM Decision

Quality Escalation Path:
  Quality Issue → QA Development Lead → TPM/PM Joint Review → Resolution

Timeline Escalation Path:
  Delivery Risk → PM Assessment → TPM Technical Impact Review → Joint Resolution
```

## Conflict Resolution Framework

### Common Conflict Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Technical Debt vs. Feature Delivery
**Conflict**: Technical debt threatens code quality, but features are needed for user milestones
**Resolution Protocol**:
1. **TPM Assessment**: Quantify technical risk and maintenance cost
2. **PM Assessment**: Quantify user impact and business risk
3. **Joint Decision**: Balance immediate needs with long-term sustainability
4. **Compromise Solution**: Often involves phased approach or reduced scope

#### Scenario 2: Performance Optimization vs. Timeline
**Conflict**: Performance optimization needed but timeline pressure for features
**Resolution Protocol**:
1. **TPM Analysis**: Performance impact on user experience and scalability
2. **PM Analysis**: Timeline impact and stakeholder expectations
3. **Joint Solution**: Priority-based optimization with clear success metrics
4. **Monitoring Agreement**: Performance monitoring with agreed thresholds

#### Scenario 3: Technology Adoption vs. Delivery Speed
**Conflict**: New technology would improve architecture but slow current delivery
**Resolution Protocol**:
1. **TPM Evaluation**: Long-term benefits and learning curve assessment
2. **PM Evaluation**: Short-term delivery impact and risk assessment
3. **Joint Decision**: Timeline for adoption with pilot implementation
4. **Success Metrics**: Clear evaluation criteria for technology adoption success
